# My Blog

Welcome to my blog! Here I will write about my progress in Python and projects.

## Entry 1
I created my own static site generator.  
It takes Markdown files, parses metadata, and renders them into HTML.

## Entry 2
Next steps: learn Flask or FastAPI to build dynamic backend applications.
